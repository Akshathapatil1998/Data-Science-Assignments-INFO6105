## Background
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose function over a period of time, usually months to years. This can lead to a buildup of waste products and fluids in the body, as well as an imbalance of important electrolytes. The disease can be caused by a number of factors, including diabetes(Sugar levels), high blood pressure, Hemoglobin and other diseases that affect the kidneys. The data is provided for almost 400 patients and we are required to build an intelligent model that can predict if the patient will be prone to disease based on several medical parameters .

## What is our ultimate aim with this notebook?
Our ultimate aim is to build a machine learning model that can predict if the person is suffering from Chronic Kidney Disease based on sevrral medical parameters as mentioned above. Before we create a model we need to do some data cleaning, feature selection and exploratory data analysis of the kaggle dataset.
