## Background
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition where the kidneys gradually lose function over a period of time, usually months to years. This can lead to a buildup of waste products and fluids in the body, as well as an imbalance of important electrolytes. The disease can be caused by a number of factors, including diabetes(Sugar levels), high blood pressure, Hemoglobin and other diseases that affect the kidneys. The data is provided for almost 400 patients and we are required to build an intelligent model that can predict if the patient will be prone to disease based on several medical parameters .


## Abstract

The objective of this project is to diagnostically predict whether a patient is having chronic kidney disease or not, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Class(renamed to ChronicKidneyDisease).

## Aim:
In this project we aim to develop a complete ML project with

- Checking Data Quality by performing different EDA techniques
- Feature Selection
- Modeling - Training Models, Selecting Best Model, Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Interpretibility
- Reports and Visualizations
